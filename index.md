My name is Alice and I am a second-year student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University. 

My passion for innovation and problem-solving has led me to be a part of Cornell Racing, the university's Formula Student Team. Here I have gained hands-on experience in designing and building race cars. This opportunity has not only sharpened my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork and effective communication.

In addition to my engineering pursuits, I have a developed a keen passion for sports media production and videography. I have had the privilege of working on live broadcasts for ESPN sport. This opportunity has provided me with valuable experience in filming, graphic production and live broadcasting. It has also allowed me to combine my technical expertise and attention to detail with my passion for sports to create engaging content for a nation-wide audience.

I am now seeking to leverage my skills and experiences to make a meaningful contribution in professional industry and I am confident that my unique combination of technical skills and creative flair would make me a valuable asset to any organization.
