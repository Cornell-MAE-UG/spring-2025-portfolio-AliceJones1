I am currently working on a design project for a suspension system for a Formula One styled race car. I desperately wanted a way of learning and practicing CAD work, so I started off by downloading Fusion 360 and watching some basic tutorials online since I had not previously used it. I really enjoyed learning the basics of CAD and found myself spending lots of time adjusting and editing different designs. I was also looking for a way to learn more about motorsport engineering, so instead of trying to learn and understand two concepts separately, I decided to combine the two and start designing a double wishbone suspension system. It is very much work in progress but I am loving the process of designing and I am constantly looking out for ways that I can improve a) my use of the software and b) my design skills. 



I started out by designing a brake rotor and then moved onto the more complex challenge of the upright. Now I have been on Cornell Racing for a while, I would like to revisit these parts after watching members on the team dedicate a year to their design. 


The next step in my deisgn for these parts is to run some FEA to understand more clearly how they will fare under loading expected of an F1 car. I also want to inventigate some more failure modes.
