<br>In my Mechanical Syntheis and Design Class, we were tasked with modelling an everyday object in CAD and generating renders.<br><br> I chose a pencil sharpener and worked to model the indiviual components. I took time to meaure the key dimensions of a sharpener to make sure that it was modelled accurately.<br>

**Summary of the Parts**
- Sharpener Body:
  - This was the hardest component to CAD. I started with the sketch of the outer profile and
extruded it. 
  - I then cut out the slots in the top face using the extrude feature. I then made the
main hole on the side of the sharpener. After I used an offset plane deeper into the sharpener to
sketch a smaller circle. 
  - I used the loft tool to make the space for the pencil. Finally I used a draft
to make the sharpener angled like in the real thing.
- Blade:
  - I sketched out the side profile and then extruded to make the blade. I made a hole in the blade
in the same place as on the main body.
- Sharpener Bin:
  - For this I made a solid sketch and then revolved it 360 degrees. I shelled out the center before
adding threading on the top of the bin.
- Sharpener Lid:
  - Similar to the bin, I started with a solid sketch which I revolved. I then shelled out the lid and
added threads to screw onto the bin.
