This year on Cornell's FSAE Team it has been my responsibility to design and manufacture the inboard suspension clevises, bushings (or cones) and backing plates. 

The inboard clevises serve as a mounting point for the suspension links to attach to the monocoque. Since the clevises are part of the load path between the ground and the chassis, it is critical that they can withstand the maximum load cases experienced by each respective link and transfer that force into the monocoque.

The clevis itself is U-shaped and has two holes on either clevis wall, aligned so that a bolt can pass through to act as a clevis pin. The clevis pin allows the spherical bearing at the end of a suspension link to be interfaced with the clevis. The clevis pins are mounted in double shear, and feature bushings that we refer to as “cones”. These are included to restrict the axial movement of the spherical link bearings. The suspension clevises also have mounting holes that allow it to be bolted to the monocoque.

All of the clevises were machined on a manual mill and teh cones were done on a lathe. Throughout the fall semester, I worked on the designs and finsihed up by making the manufacturing drawings, ready for them to come to life ealry in the Spring semester. We then successfully mounted the clevises onto the monocoque before integrating with the rest of teh suspension system. 

**A few key takeaways:**
- A focus on standardisation led to 6 unique clevises - down from 8 the year before
- Two new clevis designs to house rockers and anti roll bar system 
- Lighter than ARG24's clevis assembly
- Smooth integration with the monocoque and rest of suspesnion
